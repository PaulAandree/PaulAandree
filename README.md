ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Paul AndrÃ©, a Junior Data Scientist passionate about extracting insights from data and turning them into actionable solutions. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡

ðŸ”¬ My areas of interest include:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning algorithms
- Statistical modeling
- Data visualization

ðŸŽ“ I hold a Bachelor's degree in Industrial engineering from Universidad Nacional de Callao. During my Henry Data Science bootcamp studies, I gained hands-on experience in analyzing datasets, cleaning data, improving my Python skills, and building dashboards and predictive models.

ðŸ’¼ I'm currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a professional setting. I'm particularly interested in joining a team that values innovation, collaboration, and using data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems.

ðŸ’ª Here's what I bring to the table:
- Proficiency in Python, with experience in libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, backed by a solid foundation in statistics and mathematics.
- SQL knowledge and relational databases. MySQL and MSSQL 
- Knowledge of data visualization tools like Power BI, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Familiarity with cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure for data storage and processing.

ðŸŒ± I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in data science. You can find my personal projects, code samples, and data visualizations on my GitHub.
